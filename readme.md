# Alien Invasion, a Pygame minigame
This is a Pygame minigame inspired by one of the projects explained in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes.

Quoting from the book:

> In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The Player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot
> bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. Th eplayer shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player
> shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a
> ship. If the player looses three ships, the game ends.
